Cost      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Link                                                                                                                                         |

| **Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB)**                | The brain. Pi 4 also works.        | 1   | $80 - $90      | Needs WiFi capability. I specifically chose this one as I'll use it for other projects too in the future. Such a powerful Pi isn't needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)                                                                         |
| **Raspberry Pi DAC+**                   | High-quality audio output board.   | 1   | $25            | Any DAC will most likely work great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/dac-plus/)                                                                               |
| **Amplifier Board (TPA3255 SAMP-100)**  | Class D Amp, 2x315W.               | 1   | $16            | Ensure it fits your power needs for your speakers. I specifically chose this one because it was for a good price and also because these TPA3255 boards do not have the thump noise when powering on/off that TPA3166D2 boards do have.                                                                                                                                  | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006169802448.html)                                                                          |
| **Power Supply (Mean Well LRS-150-36)** | An industrial power supply         | 1   | $24            | Powers the Amp and Raspberry Pi. You can choose any PSU you need, even an external one, I would personally not choose this exact one because of coil whine and tons of electrical noise going into the amp, however it's good enough.                                                                                                                                   | Any official Mean Well store.                                                                                                                |
| ~**DC-DC Buck Converter**~              | ~Steps down 36V -> 5V for the Pi.~ | ~1~ | ~$3~           | ~Choose one specifically for your Pi, I wanted a 5A one, because the Pi 5 wants 5A to be happy. This one delivers that and shouldn't fry the Pi.~ This was NOT used in the final version as it introduced a ground loop. I decided to get a secondary official Raspberry Pi PSU for the Pi 5. This does add another cable, but allows the Pi to run 24/7 with no noise. | ~[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009039465768.html)~ [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/27w-power-supply/) |
| **Buttons**                             | For Vol +/-, Play/Pause.           | 3   | $1 each        | I specifically chose ones that can sense a finger from a few milimeters away, because they'll be under the surface in the enclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004477188195.html)                                                                          |
| **White LEDs**                          | Status feedback.                   | 1   | $2 for 50-pack | I chose white color for a minimalistic look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006885163813.html)                                                                          |
| **PANASONIC AQY212EHAT opto-coupler**   | For controlled AMP muting.         | 1   | $3             | Because my AMP supports hardware muting when two pins are shorted, I am using an opto-coupler to control the short with the RPi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Any local electronics store                                                                                                                  |

| :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Woofer (4 inch)**       | Mid-bass driver.        | 1            | $25       | I chose the Dayton Audio TCP115-4 4", good little woofer for a good price. | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dayton-Audio-TCP115-4-Treated-Midbass/dp/B077FHPGM4) |
| **Tweeter (2 inch)**      | Silk dome tweeters.     | 1 (set of 2) | $7        | These tweeters are pretty decent for the price.                            | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007917972560.html)                  |
| **Mid speakers (3 inch)** | Mid frequency speakers. | 1 (set of 2) | $11       | These are not all that great, but they get the job done.                   | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007256226541.html)                  |
| **High-pass filter**      | For tweeters.           | 1            | $4        | You don't need it if you're not using tweeters.                            | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001361438676.html)                  |

### Enclosure & Misc

| Item                                  | Description                                 | Notes                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PETG Filament**                     | About 1 kg of filament used + wood.         | PCTG _might_ be better.                                                                                                     |
| **Wooden board**                      | For the outer enclosure.                    | Makes it look neat and saves plastic.                                                                                       |
| **Plaster of paris mixture with PVA** | Acoustic stuffing for the woofer enclosure. | A classic 1:1 PoP mixture with a bit of added PVA to make it less brittle.                                                  |
| **Screws / Binding Posts**            | For rigid links.                            | An y nice looking screws, I chose black DIN 7984.                                                                           |
| **Various cables**                    | For all connections.                        | You should choose a cable thick enough to handle the power. I chose 14 AWG cables for power and 1.5qmm cables for speakers. |

**Total Estimated Cost:** ~$200 - $250 USD
